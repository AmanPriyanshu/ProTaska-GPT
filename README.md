# 🚀 ProTaska-GPT

**Your AI-powered data companion 🤖**


Specify your dataset of choice, and ProTaska-GPT generates a tailored codebase, empowering you to visualize and understand the dataset with tasks, tutorials, and actionable insights. Accelerate your data science journey with ease and efficiency!

## 🖊️ Key Features:

1. **Dataset Ingestion:** ProTaska-GPT seamlessly integrates with dataset sources like Kaggle and Hugging Face (_for now_), allowing users to easily import and work with diverse datasets.
2. **Task Recommendations:** Leveraging its GPT-backbone, it generates a customized set of tasks tailored to each dataset, providing users with valuable project ideas and challenges.
3. **Algorithm Suggestions:** Based on the dataset characteristics, it suggests suitable machine learning algorithms, enabling users to make informed decisions during their project journey.
4. **Conversational Chatbot:** Allow user to discuss about different techniques and scrape information from Wikipedia to give relevant responses.

## 🔎 Objectives:
1. **Beginner-Friendly Tutorials**: ProTaska-GPT aims to offer automated generation of a collection of beginner-friendly tutorials that guide users through common data science workflows, step-by-step, fostering practical learning and skill development.

## Installation:

`pip install ProTaska-GPT --upgrade`

## 📈 Usage:

Importing base descriptors and ideation bot:
```
from protaska.describer import describe_dataset
from protaska.ideate import main as chatbot
```

Providing meta-data about the dataset to be used:
```
openai_key = '**open-ai-secret-key**'
importer_type = "HuggingFaceDatasetImporter"
dataset_key = 'mteb/tweet_sentiment_extraction'
destination_path = './downloaded_data/'
```

Getting automated data descriptions:
```
description, dataloader_obj = describe_dataset(openai_key, importer_type, destination_path, dataset_key)
description
```

Running an interactive ChatBot for ideation and base-code building:
```
chatbot(openai_key, description, dataloader_obj.superficial_meta_data, agent_verbose=False)
```
